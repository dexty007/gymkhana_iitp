                      Indian Institutes of technology have always been the
                      cradle that groomed many a brilliant author in the
                      country, thanks to those who still cherish the spark
                      despite the technological work load they confront day
                      after day. The founding of literary club produced a
                      platform conducive for nurturing such talents in today's
                      students of technology. For all those who know that the
                      "pen is mightier than the sword", this is very well their
                      arena. Talents are to be shown, not to be hidden. Some of
                      the most successful and crowd pulling events in the
                      institute were organized under the literary club such as
                      the treasure hunt, love letter writing, arbit speaking,
                      and so forth. The literary club of IITP represented the
                      college in "Rendezvous of Colleges", a parliamentary
                      debate competition held in the Magadh Mahila College in
                      Patna and bagged the first prize out of all participating
                      twenty colleges.
